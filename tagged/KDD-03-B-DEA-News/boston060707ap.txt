Years in Federal Prison for Dealing Crack
JUN 7  -- June W. Stansbury, Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration in New England and Kevin J. O'Connor, United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, announced that HARRY JOHNSON, age 31, of Meriden, Connecticut, was sentenced yesterday, June 6, by Senior United States District Judge Peter C. Dorsey in New Haven to 151 months of imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release, for conspiring to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base ("crack cocaine"). JOHNSON pleaded guilty to the charge on February 26, 2007.
On October 4, 2006, a federal grand jury returned an Indictment charging JOHNSON and several other individuals with various narcotics offenses involving the distribution of cocaine and crack cocaine in Meriden and the surrounding area. The charges against JOHNSON predominantly emanate from several controlled purchases of ounce-quantities of crack from him in October 2005.
This investigation was a collaborative effort of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Meriden Police Department.
