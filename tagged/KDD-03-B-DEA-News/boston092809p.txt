Hartford Man Sentenced to Federal Prison for Illegal Firearm Possession
SEP 28  -- Steven W. Derr, Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration for New England and Nora R. Dannehy, United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, announced that WADE HACKETT, 37, of Hartford, was sentenced today by United States District Judge Robert N. Chatigny in Hartford to 18 months of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release, the first six months of which HACKETT must serve in community confinement (halfway house). On May 6, 2009, HACKETT pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a previously convicted felon.
According to documents filed with the Court and statements made in court, on February 26, 2009, federal agents and Hartford Police executed a court-authorized search of HACKETT's 36 Belmont Street residence and seized a Glock, model 17, 9mm, semiautomatic pistol; a Smith & Wesson, model 10-7, .38 special revolver; and various types of ammunition.
The Glock pistol had been reported stolen in Farmington in December 2007.
On October 3, 1994, HACKETT was convicted in New York for attempted robbery in the second degree, a felony.
It is a violation of federal law for a person previously convicted of a felony offense to possess a firearm or ammunition that has moved in interstate or foreign commerce.
This matter was investigated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the Hartford Police Department.
