SEP 9  -- LOUISVILLE, KY - , U.S. Attorney David L. Huber of the Western District of Kentucky announced today that a federal grand jury in Louisville returned a Superceding Indictment, charging conspiracy to attempt to possess and distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine against 
Steven Lee Fowler, Jr. , of 3723 Ethel Avenue, Louisville, Kentucky, 
Paul Eugene Smith , of 1027 Seelbach Avenue, Louisville, Kentucky, 
Jose Alfaro Mendez, a/k/a Papi , a non United States citizen, and 
Ciricao Carranco Lucio , a/k/a Primo, age 28, a non United States citizen.
The Superceding Indictment filed today expanded the date of the conspiracy contained in the original Indictment, and added a count of attempted possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine for each previously indicted defendant. According to an affidavit, previously filed in support of a criminal complaint against the four defendants, Special Agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) conducted an operation on June 12, 2008, in which the four defendants attempted to purchase eight kilograms of cocaine for $21,500.00 per kilogram. After attempting to make the purchase, all four defendants were arrested and the Special Agents of the DEA seized $182,000 in cash.
In the event of a conviction the maximum potential penalties, each defendant faces are life imprisonment, a $4,000,000.00 fine, and supervised release for a period of 4 years. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Mac Shannon, and it was investigated by the DEA.
The defendants are scheduled for trial on September 23, 2008 before the United States Judge, Jennifer B. Coffman, in Louisville, Kentucky.
