"Crystal Darkness" Broadcast Throughout Northern Nevada
JAN 11  -- (RENO) - On January 9, 2007, at 7:30 p.m., the Drug Enforcement Administration's Reno Resident Office joined forces with several community groups throughout the Reno area to promote the dangers of methamphetamine. The majority of the local Reno TV channels and many cable stations throughout northern Nevada broadcast a 30-minute documentary entitled "Crystal Darkness: Meth's Deadly Assault on Nevada's Youth". The documentary was developed by several community groups in the Reno area to include: Washoe County Secret Witness; Washoe Community Meth Response Alliance; Join Together Northern Nevada.
The purpose of the documentary was to show the ramifications of methamphetamine addiction through the stories of local users, jailed and recovering. The program was targeted at youth and their parents, but the message applies throughout our communities. After the broadcast, over 200 calls were received at a call center was that was set up to receive calls from concerned citizens who needed treatment or information about methamphetamine.
