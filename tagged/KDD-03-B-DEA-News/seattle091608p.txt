Everett Man Sentenced to 10 Years for Oxycodone Distribution
SEP 16  -- 
(Seattle)  - DEA Special Agent in Charge (SAC) Arnold R. Moorin and the United States Attorney for the Western District of Washington, Jeffrey Sullivan, announced that Timothy Ray Bland, 28, of Everett, Washington was sentenced on September 12, 2008 to ten years in prison for Conspiracy to Distribute Oxycodone and Attempted Possession with Intent to Distribute Oxycodone. At the time of sentencing U.S District Judge Ricardo Martinez approved a negotiated sentence that requires Bland to serve his federal sentence at the same time he serves a 12 year state sentence for a kidnapping and rape conviction.
According to records filed in the case, Bland was identified by law enforcement as they attempted to determine the source of Oxycodone pills being distributed in the Kitsap County area. Bland distributed thousands of Oxycodone pills every few weeks that he obtained from his California source of supply. Bland paid hundreds of thousands of dollars at one time for as many as 9,000 pills. Including Bland, a total of 5 others were charged in Federal District Court in Seattle as part of the scheme, one of whom was the supplier who was transporting the drugs from Los Angeles to Seattle.
This case was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Bremerton Police Department and the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office.
