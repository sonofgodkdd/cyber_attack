Cocaine Conspiracy Conviction  Nets Kentucky Man Life Sentence
 - Myron Young had three prior drug trafficking convictions
JUL 23  -- (Bowling Green, KY) - U.S. Attorney David J. Hale of the Western District of Kentucky announced that on July 20, 2010, Myron Young, age 41, of Campbellsville, Kentucky, was sentenced to life imprisonment in United States District Court, for conspiracy to distribute more than fifty grams of cocaine base. Joseph H. McKinley Jr., Judge, United States District Court, imposed the life sentence, in accordance with Federal law, due to Young's prior criminal history which included three prior drug trafficking convictions. 
There is no parole in the federal judicial system.
Young was found guilty after a jury trial in April. His son, Zachary Young, was charged in the same indictment but entered a guilty plea. Having no prior drug convictions, the son was sentenced to five years imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release.
The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Larry Fentress, and it was investigated by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Kentucky State Police Drug Task Force, and the Campbellsville Police Department.
