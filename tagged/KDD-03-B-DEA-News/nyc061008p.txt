Memorial to Jonathon Cote
JUN 10  -- Body of Jonathon Cote, stepson of DEA Buffalo Resident in Charge, Nancy Cote' found brutally killed in Iraq.
Jonathon Cote' was a veteran who served four years in the United States Army, 82nd Airborne Division which included tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was honorably discharged from the service in 2005 and attended one year of college at the University of Florida before joining Crescent Security Group (CSG) in June of 2006. CSG provided security to personnel and convoy transports within the Country of Iraq.
On November 16, 2006, Jonathan, along with three other American veterans and an Austrian veteran all working for CSG, were kidnapped in Southern Iraq while providing security for an Italian Military convoy. For 17 long months the families waited to hear word on their loved ones.
In March of 2008, the bodies of the other hostages were recovered in southern Iraq and in late April 2008, Jonathan's body was recovered. Jon was scheduled to return home on November 22, 2006 for the holidays then return back to college in Florida.
A memorial service for Jonathon was held in Buffalo, NY on May 2, 2008. It was extremely well attended and was a beautiful tribute to his all too short life. The Cote's attribute their strong Christian faith in getting them through this most difficult time.
