Operation Zamboni Breaks the "Ice" in Methamphetamine Organization
Four Arrested and Thirteen Pounds Methamphetamine Ice Seized
NOV 3  -- (Terre Haute, IN) - Gary G. Olenkiewicz, Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration announced the arrest of four people subsequent to the seizure of thirteen pounds methamphetamine "ice" from a Mexican drug trafficking organization. The arrests and seizure was made by agents and officers of the DEA Evansville office and Vigo County Drug Task Force. Two vehicles and $2,100.00 in U. S. Currency were also seized from the organization.
"Methamphetamine has become a cancer in communities across the nation," said Olenkiewicz. "Operation Zamboni is the result of two years' tireless investigative work with our state and local Task Forces to rid the area of this highly addictive narcotic. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to ensure these dangerous drugs stay off the streets."
The Evansville DEA office started Operation Zamboni in January of 2005 by conducting several undercover purchases from Kenneth Harlan. Harlan has since pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, and is facing a twenty year minimum mandatory sentence. Investigators were able to identify Harlan's source of supply for the methamphetamine which led to the thirteen pound seizure on October 28, 2006. The operation was a success at dismantling a Mexican methamphetamine distribution organization that involved transporting narcotics to the United States from Mexico through Texas for distribution in Indiana.
Arrested in Terre Haute, Indiana for conspiracy to distribute over 500 grams of methamphetamine were Everardo Cuevas, Jorge Morales, Astrid Corral-Sanchez and Maria Veliz.
The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Bradley Blackington of the Southern District of Indiana.
