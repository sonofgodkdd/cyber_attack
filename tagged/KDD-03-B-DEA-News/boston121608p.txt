in Narcotics Distribution Ring
DEC 16 -- Kevin L. Lane, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration for New England, and Nora R. Dannehy, Acting United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, announced that JOSE GARCIA, also known as "Peliche," 25, of Waterbury, was sentenced today by United States District Judge Mark R. Kravitz in New Haven to 120 months of imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release, for conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine. GARCIA pleaded guilty to the offense on September 25, 2007.
According to documents filed with the Court and statements made in court, this matter stems from "Operation Crown Royal," a collaborative long-term investigation into the distribution of cocaine, crack cocaine and heroin in central Connecticut. During the investigation, GARCIA was intercepted on numerous occasions facilitating the packaging and delivery of cocaine and crack cocaine to various individuals at the direction of Luis A. Colon, also known as "Anthony."
On July 12, 2007, Colon pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine. He awaits sentencing.
This investigation was a collaborative effort of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Waterbury Police Department and the Meriden Police Department.
