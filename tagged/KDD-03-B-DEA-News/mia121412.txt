Oxycodone Dealer Gets Statutory Maximum
DEC 14 (TAMPA, Fla.)  - Mark R. Trouville, Special Agent in Charge, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Miami Field Division, and Robert E. O'Neill, United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida, announced today that U.S. District Judge Susan C. Bucklew sentenced Samuel Posa (42, Tampa) to the statutory maximum of 20 years in federal prison and 10 years of supervised release. On September 20, 2012, a federal jury found Posa guilty of one count of conspiracy to distribute and dispense Oxycodone outside the usual course of professional practice and not for legitimate medical purposes, and two counts of distribution and possession with intent to distribute Oxycodone.
According to court documents, between May 2009 and October 2010, Posa conspired with Blake Barton, M.D. (now deceased) and Lea Ann Locklear to fill more than 240 prescriptions of Oxycodone at more than 16 pharmacies in the Tampa Bay area. In total, the conspirators obtained more than 50,000 pills of Oxycodone. These prescriptions were not based on any legitimate medical need of Posa. Through their scheme, the conspirators were able to fill multiple prescriptions for Oxycodone in the same month and even on the same day, completely unbeknownst to the pharmacies they were patronizing.
Locklear previously pleaded guilty for her role in the scheme. On January 25, 2012, she was sentenced to five years in federal prison.
This case was investigated by the DEA Tampa District Office. Mr. Trouville commends the prosecution efforts of the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida.
