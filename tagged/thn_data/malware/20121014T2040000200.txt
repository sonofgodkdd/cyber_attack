A very quick and urgent warning for Twitter users, If you receive a direct message (DM) on Twitter saying "My profile was viewed..times..today" with a link then please don't click it. If you do, you will run the risk of having your Twitter account hijacked, your account turned into a spam-spewing tweet factory and all of your Twitter followers will be sent a personal copy of the same DM saying "My profile was viewed..times..today".
The direct message is a Scam aimed at stealing your twitter account.

We recommend you to:
DO not click the link.
