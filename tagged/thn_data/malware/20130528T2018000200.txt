The worrisome fact is that whether you are a pirate of not, the malware will be installed on your computer, discreetly keeping an eye on everything you get off the Internet. If you have some pirated movies or songs on your computer, you could be deemed an IP thief and have nasty things done to your system by rights holders if counterattacks were legalized.
