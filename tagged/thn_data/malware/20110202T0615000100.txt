Insider threats, botnets and malware, and assay to abutment the Comprehensive Civic Cyber Initiative (CNCI) are amid areas of cybersecurity advance the Department of Homeland Aegis (DHS) will accomplish in budgetary year 2011.
The DHS Science and Technology Homeland Aegis Advanced Assay Projects Bureau (HSARPA) is gluttonous proposals on 14 areas of cybersecurity assay it affairs to focus on this year, bristles of which will accord to the CNCI, a alternation of efforts to accommodate front-line aegis adjoin cybersecurity threats, according to a Broad Bureau Announcement acquaint on FedBizOpps.gov. The absolute amount of the accretion is $40 million.
The DHS has been advance in cybersecurity for a brace of years through HSARPA, and this year shows the bureau absorption on both acceptable methods of aegis such ascomputer application assurance, enterprise-level aegis metrics, and arrangement resiliency, as able-bodied as added forward-thinking areas of assay such as authoritative aegis added convenient to artisan abundance and arrangement mapping and measurement.
Topics additionally accommodate areas that became analytical aegis apropos for the government aftermost year, such as cabal threats -- accent by the Wikileaks aspersion -- and creating clay and assay capabilities to adumbrate the furnishings of cyberattacks such as botnets and malware on federal government and added analytical infrastructure, absorption in which agitated afterwards the assay of aftermost year's Stuxnet worm.
The technology areas HSARPA will focus on to abutment CNCI additionally represent an absorption in responding to added abreast aegis threats to ensure aegis actuality developed can accommodated approaching threats.
"The eyes of the CNCI assay association over the abutting 10 years is to 'transform the cyber-infrastructure to be aggressive to advance so that analytical civic interests are adequate from adverse accident and our association can confidently accept fresh abstruse advances,'" HSARPA said in its RFP. "The alone abiding band-aid to the vulnerabilities of today's networking and advice technologies is to ensure that approaching ancestors of these technologies are advised with aegis congenital in from the arena up."
Topics of absorption the bureau will advance in to abutment this ambition accommodate cyber economics, the banking allurement for hackers to accomplish cyberattacks; agenda provenance, which focuses on the adventure of abstracts from agent to consumer; and hardware-enabled trust, which aims to accommodate added aegis in accretion accouterments than exists today.
Other abreast and approaching aegis technologies HSARPA seeks ascribe on accommodate moving-target defense, which goes above aegis for changeless technology; nature-inspired cyber health, which encourages systems to be acquainted of and acknowledge to threats inherently; and acomputer application affirmation exchange to actualize fresh methods, services, and capabilities in build, test, and assay phases ofcomputer application development.
