Palo Alto says:
“The malware hooks system processes through MobileSubstrate, and steals Apple account usernames, passwords, and device GUID by intercepting iTunes traffic on the device."
"KeyRaider steals Apple push notification service certificates and private keys, steals and shares App Store purchasing information, and disables local and remote unlocking functionalities on iPhones and iPads”
