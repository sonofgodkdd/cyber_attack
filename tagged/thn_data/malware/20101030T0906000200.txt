Fix a Windows Infection Using Linux - LiveCDs
Mohit Kumar
If you use Linux on your company's desktop or  server computers, you're already familiar with many of the security advantages theÂ open source operating system offers over its Windows  and Mac rivals. What many people don't realize, however, is that Linux  can also be used to rescue a computer that has been crippled by malware.Malware is a frequent occurrence in the Windows world, in  particular, and it can be devastating. When a Windows virus strikes, not  only can it become difficult or even impossible to continue using the  affected machine, but it can be dangerous as well, since prolonged use  can further the infection.
That's where Linux can be a  life-saver. Without ever having to install the free alternative, you can  still use it temporarily on a PC to get rid of any infection. Here's  how.
1. Get a LiveCD or Live USB
LiveCDs and USBs are a  wonderful thing in the Linux world because they let you boot a machine  directly from the CD or USB stick without ever having to access the  computer's boot records. Not only are they a great way to take  Linux for a test-drive, but they can also be put to work when  Windows can't.
By far the fastest way to get a LiveCD or USB is  to download the .iso file of the Linux distribution you'd like to use  and then burn it onto a CD or USB stick. Since Ubuntu is the most  popular distribution out there, I'll go with Maverick  Meerkat--the latest version of the software--for this example.
Ubuntu  can be downloaded from the project's Website for  use on a LiveCD or USB; download links for other distributions can be  found listed on FrozenTech.  UNetbootin is another  nice option if you want to go the USB route, which tends to run much  faster.
Of course, to take either of these options you'll have to  have a working, Internet-connected computer. If you don't, or if your  Internet connection is slow, you may want to order a LiveCD or USB via  snail mail. OSDisc  and LinuxCD both offer a variety  of options; pricing is about $2.
2. Boot into Linux
Once  you're equipped with a Linux LiveCD or USB, you'll need to make sure the  infected computer is turned off, and then turn it on again with the CD  or USB installed. This will boot the computer into Linux, completely  bypassing Windows and its infection. Again, nothing has been installed  -- you're simply using Linux to get the machine running reliably again.
3. Get Antivirus Software
Next it's time to get the  Linux-based ammunition you'll need to wipe out the malware: antivirus  software. I'm going to use ClamAV, my favorite, via ClamTK, which  provides a nice graphical front end.
From the main Ubuntu desktop, then, go to "Applications" and then  "Ubuntu Software Center." Choose "Edit" and then "Software Sources."  You'll be presented with a box entitled, "Downloadable from the  Internet," and you should be sure all four boxes are checked before you  click on "Close."
Next, from the main Ubuntu Software Center  page, click on the "Accessories" icon and type ClamTK into the search  box. It will be shown as "Virus Scanner," but if you click on "More  Info" you can verify it's the right package. Click "Install" and wait  for it to download.
Once installation is finished, you should  launch ClamTK by going to "Applications" in Ubuntu's main menu, then  "Accessories" and "Virus Scanner," which is how the software will still  be shown.
4. Run a Scan
When the ClamTK window opens,  click on the "Scan" tab and select the option for a Recursive Scan.  Next, you'll need to tell the software which drive you want to check for  viruses, which in this case is the one that includes Windows. Scanning  may take some time, but once the infection is found you'll get the usual  options for what to do with it, including quarantine and removal.
5.  Return to Normal
Assuming the infection has now been removed,  your computer should be clean once again, making it safe to remove the  LiveCD or USB and boot back into Windows as usual. As you enjoy your  malware-free machine once again, remember that it's all thanks to Linux.  It's also not a bad idea to keep your LiveCD or USB handy so you'll be  ready for the next time.
