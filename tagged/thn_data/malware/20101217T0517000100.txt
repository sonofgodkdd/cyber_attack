PacketFence v2.0.0 - Latest Version !
Mohit Kumar
“PacketFencePacketFence is an open-source network access control (NAC) system which provides the following features: registration, detection of abnormal network activities, proactive vulnerability  scans, isolation of problematic devices, remediation through a captive portal, 802.1X, wireless  integration and DHCP fingerprinting.“
This is the official change log:
New Hardware Support
* SMC TigerStack 6128 L2 support in Port Security (feature sponsored by Seattle Pacific University)
* HP ProCurve MSM710 Mobility Controller
* Meru Networks MC3000 Wireless Controller
* Juniper EX Series in MAC RADIUS (Juniper’s MAC Authentication)
New Features
* Simplification of the Wireless, Wired 802.1X and Wired MAC Authentication configuration. Because of a new FreeRADIUS module and a Web Service interface, everything is now using standard PacketFence proccesses and configuration files.
* VoIP devices authorization over RADIUS (#1008)
* Proxy interception. PacketFence can now operate in an environment where there is a client-side proxy configured. Check proxy-bypass in addons/ for details. (#1035)
* Passthroughs support! You can now configure PacketFence to let your users reach specific websites even if they are in registration or isolation. (#772) (feature sponsored by Shippensburg University)
* New pf::web::custom extension point to customize the captive portal’s code without the usual maintenance burden on upgrades (#1045)
* Bulk importation of nodes through CLI or Admin Web interface
* New parameter in switches.conf to ease FreeRADIUS integration
* Optional automatic configuration of FreeRADIUS’ clients using switches.conf (see addons/freeradius-integration/README for details)
* New ‘pending’ status for node. Allows for a wide range of captive portal workflows where an administrator approves network access (by email, SMS…)
