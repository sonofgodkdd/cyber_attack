Mohit Kumar

In an effort to fight cyber terrorism  in Brazil, Panda Security has signed an agreement to support the  training of the Brazilian Army’s operational agents engaged in the  battle against Internet-based crime and strategic intervention for cyber  warfare.
Panda Security will  also provide endpoint protection to 37,500 computers belonging to the  Army’s Military Commands to counter malware, targeted attacks and web  threats.
Panda’s anti-malware lab, PandaLabs, will also work with the Army’s  Cyber-Warfare Communication Center to train those involved in the  scientific and forensic investigation of cyber crime. The collaboration  will involve the exchange of malware samples, and Panda will provide a  rapid response and classification of malicious codes impacting Brazil.
Brig. Gen. Antonino dos Santos Guerra Neto said Brazil has roughly  60,000 computers, and it experiences an average of 100 probes every day  across its 12 IT centers.
“We want to protect the integrity of our systems and be prepared for  any potentially critical situation,” he said.
Panda Security CEO Juan  Santana said the experience with the Brazilian Army will help  continue the technological evolution of the company’s security  solutions, which will benefit all Panda users worldwide.
“It will also help create a safer web, which is one of our principal  mission values and an integral part of our corporate social  responsibility efforts,” he said.
