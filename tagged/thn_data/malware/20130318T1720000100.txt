The app is designed to steals all details in the device's contact list and are uploaded to a predetermined server.
Symantec confirmed that there are several variants of this app exist, "..the latest variants have added an interesting payload: rather than sending SMS messages to the victim’s friends and family, the ultimate goal is to scam the victim with something similar to what is called one-click fraud in Japan" Hamada said on blog.
