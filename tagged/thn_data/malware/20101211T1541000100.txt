Beware : WikiLeaks fans should think before they botnet !
Mohit Kumar
Do you support WikiLeaks? Are you mad at critics trying to snuff it out? Maybe you're thinking about joining the online protests aimed at shutting down the Web sites of its opponents. Don't.
A loosely organized group of vigilantes under the name Anonymous have turned the botnet guns of their Operation Payback campaign, which previously targeted antipiracy organizations, on PayPal, Visa, MasterCard, Senator Joe Lieberman, Sarah Palin, and others who have criticized WikiLeaks or stopped doing business with the document-sharing project. The WikiLeaks fallout has hit a frenzy since the site began releasing diplomatic cables last month that have proved embarrassing for the U.S. government's diplomatic efforts.
The modern-day equivalent of walking the picket line with a sign is launching denial-of-service attacks against target Web sites in order to send a message and try to interfere with their business. But the electronic version is illegal.
"Participating in a botnet with the intention of shutting down a Web site violates the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act," said Jennifer Granick, a lawyer at Zwillinger Genetski who specializes in Internet law and hacking cases. "The thing people need to understand is that even if you have a political motive, it doesn't change the fact that the activity is unlawful."
One person accused of being connected with the  attacks has already been arrested. Police in the Netherlands arrested  a 16-year-old hacker earlier this week. It's unclear what his role  allegedly was. 
Typical botnets are created by criminals who use  viruses and other methods to sneak malware onto computers that then  allows them to commandeer the machines for distributed denial-of-service  (DOS) attacks without the computer owners knowing it. Hijacked  computers are being used in the Operation Payback campaign, but the  focus has been getting individuals to voluntarily join.
Thousands  of people from around the world are downloading the LOIC (Low Orbit Ion  Cannon) software so that their computer will attack the targets the  Anonymous organizers specify. New versions of the DOS tool have emerged  this week. There is a version for Linux and a Windows version that  includes a "Hivemind" feature to connect to an Internet Relay Chat  server and allow the organizers to control what site the computer  targets. 
There is even a JavaScript version that runs on any  device, including smart phones. "The JavaScript one, you just point the  browser at a site and say 'go,'" said Jose Nazario, senior manager of  security research at Arbor Networks.
As many as 3,000 computers  voluntarily participated in attacks earlier this week, and an estimated  30,000 others appeared to be hijacked, according to Sean-Paul Correll, a  threat researcher at Panda Labs who has been following  the attacks closely and communicating with Operation Payback  organizers. 
There's a snag, however, for the volunteer botnet  protesters--their Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are not masked, so  the attacks could ultimately be traced back to the computers launching  them, experts say. Of course, it's up to the discretion of prosecutors  as to whether or not individual botnet volunteers will be fingered by  authorities. 
"There may be strength in numbers," said Granick.  "There's only so many people the police could go after. But that doesn't  mean that they couldn't find out who is behind the unmasked IP numbers  and file computer charges against them."
Operation Payback is  fending off DOS attacks that have scuttled its efforts. The servers  being used to provide the infrastructure for Operation Payback have been  taken offline intermittently. No one has taken responsibility for those  attacks. "Right now it appears they are regrouping and strategizing for  future attacks," said Correll. (Anonymous  explains that its goal is to raise awareness not interfere with  targets' critical infrastructure.)
Meanwhile, a separate campaign  sprang up out of nowhere that could give WikiLeaks fans a more legal  way of expressing their support for the cause. An online flyer for  "Operation Leakspin" published by Boing  Boing encourages people to find juicy bits in the leaked cables and  spread them virally on the Internet in blog posts and YouTube videos  and use unrelated tags that will ensure broad interest. 
It's  unclear who is behind Operation Leakspin. "There's no hierarchical  structure (to the Anonymous collective), so when things happen, like  their server infrastructure is under attack, people tend to want to take  control of the campaign," Correll said. 
"Even though thousands  of people want to participate there doesn't seem to be a cohesive plan  about what to do next," he said. "It's fizzling out."
