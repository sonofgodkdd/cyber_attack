Oh MY God! Is Tracy Morgan Really Dead? NO, Thankfully it’s only a hoax, but scammers announced the popular comedian and actor Tracy Morgan dead. 
Another Facebook scam is circulating across the social networking website just a day before the former “Saturday Night Live” and “30 Rock” star Tracy Morgan was critically hurt in a six-vehicle fatal accident on the New Jersey Turnpike that killed his friend and writer 62-year-old James McNair.
With the rise in various scams on the popular social networking giant, Facebook that has more than one billion active users, it became very clear that not only does the social networking platform provide special opportunities for people to connect and share information, but serves as a great platform for scammers as well.
