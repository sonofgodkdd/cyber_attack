Exposed : HBGary wanted to suppress Stuxnet research !
Mohit Kumar

It is no secret that in recent days, Anonymous Operatives have released a cache of HBGary Federal internal emails to the public. Crowdleaks has discovered that within these communications, Aaron Barr received a copy of Stuxnet (a computer worm that targets the types of industrial control systems (ICS) that are commonly used in infrastructure supporting facilities) from McAfee on July 28, 2010.
In an effort to confirm this was in fact Stuxnet, Crowdleaks has decompiled some of the source code, which can be found. Throughout the following emails it is revealed that HBGary Federal may have been planning to useStuxnet for their own purposes.In a message sent to all email account holders at HBGary.com, Charles Copeland (Lead Support Engineer at HBGary, Inc.) writes:from: Charles Copeland

30,000 Windows PCs in the country, multiple Iranian news services reported on Saturday.http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9188018/Iran_confirms_massive_Stuxnet_infection_of_industrial_systemsI’ve already got a email asking about stuxnet, this came out late Friday.

contacts over at TSA say that everybody has a copy…combine that with US CERTs vulnerability status and their own systems not meeting the spec….
i’m seeing TSA becoming a malware testbed…Aaron Barr responds:On Oct 3, 2010, at 10:13 PM, Aaron Barr wrote:

Greg and I have brainstormed a bit in the past on how to conduct such an attack that would be very difficult to detect. Autonomous, single purpose malware with no C&C. As we have said the battle is on the edges either source of destination, everything else is or will become somewhat irrelevant or diminished in value.

All,
HBGary has no official position on Stuxnet. Please do not comment to the press on Stuxnet. We know nothing about Stuxnet.

CEO, HBGary, Inc.In the most chilling strand of emails, we find that whatever HBGary was working on, it was in conjunction with the NSA.Aaron Barr writes:Hi Cheryl,

hide details 11/16/09Phil, Rich,I got this word doc linked off a dangler site for Al Qaeda peeps. I think it has a US govvy payload buried inside. Would be neat to REcon it and see what it’s about. DONT open it unless in a VM obviously. password is meatflower. Remove the .txt extension too. DONT let it FONE HOME unless you want black suits landing on your front acre. :-)-Greg
Crowdleaks.org had a software engineer (whose name has been withheld) look at the Stuxnet binaries inside of a debugger and offer some insight on the worm. She informed us that most of the worms’ sources were using code similar to what is already publically available. She noted that the only remarkable thing about it was the 4 windows 0 days and the stolen certificates.She says:“A hacker did not write this, it appears to be something that would be produced by a team using a process, all of the components were created using code similar to what is already publically available. That is to say it’s ‘unremarkable’. This was created by a software development team and while the coders were professional level I am really not impressed with the end product, it looks like a picture a child painted with finger paints.”When asked what type of organization likely wrote it, she stated:“Probably a corporation by request of a government, it was clearly tested and put together by pro’s. It really looks like outsourced work.”
