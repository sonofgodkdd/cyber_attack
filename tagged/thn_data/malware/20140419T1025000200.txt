CHINA WANTS YOUR APPLE ID & PASSWORDS
Soon after the jailbroken developer uncovered the mysteries ‘Unfold.dylib’ file and found that the infection targets jailbroken iOS handsets to captures Apple IDs and passwords from Internet sessions that use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to encrypt communications and is believed to be spreading through the Chinese iOS software sites, according to the researchers at German security firm SektionEins.
The researchers found that the captured login information is been sent to some server of the Internet Protocol (IP) address “23.88.10.4”, which is suspected to be controlled by the individuals in China, as the malware developer certificate is found digitally signed by the name Wang Xin.
"Currently the jailbreak community believes that deleting the Unfold.dylib binary and changing the apple-id's password afterwards is enough to recover from this attack. However it is still unknown how the dynamic library ends up on the device in the first place and therefore it is also unknown if it comes with additional malware gifts," the researchers wrote while inspecting the infection. "We therefore believe that the only safe way of removal is a full restore, which means the removal and loss of the jailbreak," they added.
Immediately after the thread at the Reddit jailbreak community was started, several developers in the community warned the users to not touch the software, which they suspected was a malware. While the researchers noted that the manual removal of the malware infection is possible.
