According to Armorize, soccer news site Goal.com was recently found to be serving malware.
"In an analysis of the attack, Armorize researcher Wayne Huang suggests that a hacker specifically targeted and compromised Goal.com through a back-door that allowed the attacker to manipulate the siteâ€™s content at will," writes threatpost's Brian Donohue.
"According to the report, Goal.com was detected on April 27 and 28, 2011 serving up an iframe attack that forwarded visitors to a rogue domain in the .cc top level domain (TLD)," Donohue writes. "That redirect was the first in a chain of events that resulted in the delivery of a known exploit pack, g01pack that targets attacks at the specific operating system and browser version the Goal.com visitor is using. After exploiting the user's browser, further malware, including a Trojan horse program were downloaded to the victim's computer."
