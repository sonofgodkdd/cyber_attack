The new face of cyber crime
Mohit Kumar

Today's cyber crime has far-reaching implications for security  professionals. Corporate environments are experiencing more cyber  crime, and intellectual property is increasingly a target for criminal  activity.
This is according to Uri Rivner, head of new  technologies, identity protection and verification at RSA, speaking  during a roundtable at the RSA conference in London this week.
He said in the past, cyber crime was a one-man  operation – the basement hacker causing mischief. These days, he added,  it is an entire economy, run like legitimate businesses with a few  obvious exceptions.
“Online fraud is divided into two parts –  harvesting and cash out,” he said. “This translates into those stealing  and collecting the data,  and those monetising it, cashing in the accounts using the stolen  credentials.”
According to Rivner, it is ridiculously easy to  launch a Trojan attack these days, as they can be purchased off the  Internet with ease. “A Trojan costs around $700, with the famous Zeus  Trojan costing $3 000. An adware system goes for around $300 and random  crypto about $200.”
He noted that the Zeus Trojan even comes with  customer support. “Perhaps the most famous banking Trojan, it steals  data through keystroke logging. It is spread mainly through drive-by  downloads and phishing schemes. In addition, Zeus can steal other  information, or activity, such as a users' stock trading data, or even  online dating information.”
Another piece of malware responsible  for the theft of hundreds of thousands of bank account details is  Sinowal, also known as Torpig. “This is a type of botnet spread by a  variety of Trojans affecting computers using MS Windows.
“It  circumvents AV through the use of rootkit technology and scans the  infected system for credentials, accounts and passwords as well as  potentially allowing attackers full access to the computer. It is also  purportedly capable of modifying data on the computer,” he explained.
He  said these sorts of malicious programs are starting to infect  corporations. “88% of Fortune 500 companies said they had been infected  at some point.
“Both private and corporate information is stolen,  and these days it is no longer about the network, it's about the  people,” added Rivner. “We have seen an increase in 'spear phishing' or  targeting a specific employee to get control of the PC and steal company  information.”
He cites the Aurora attack as an example of this.  “Operation Aurora is a cyber attack that happened between mid-2009 and  December that year. It was first publicly disclosed by Google in January  2010, and the company said it originated in China.”
It was  reported the attack has been aimed at several companies besides Google,  with Adobe Systems, Juniper Networks and Rackspace publicly confirming  themselves as targets.
Rivner said the attack used spear phishing,  usually an e-mail containing a link to a malicious Web page, with the  exploit contained directly in its javascript, in the case of browser  exploits, or otherwise the script downloads an auxiliary file with an  exploit that targets a browser plug-in.
Either way, the PC's  security is compromised and the cyber criminal can direct the browser to  secretly download malware. Once installed, the cyber criminal has a  foothold in the corporate network, and can begin searching for the data.  “In this way, once you have the resource you have access to the  network.”
Unfortunately, Rivner said, RSA's recent research shows  many companies are unaware of the impact of malware on their systems,  and the accompanying, significant threat to their information and bottom  line.
