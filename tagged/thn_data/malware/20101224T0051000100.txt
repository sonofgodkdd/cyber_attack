Top 5 most serious internet security holes !
Mohit Kumar
Businesses can leave themselves vulnerable to date theft and other  online threats; particularly as security and IT budgets are under  pressure as businesses look to save money. Although money is tight, it  is important companies stay protected online, as on average, the total  cost of security breaches including lost business in the UK last year  was $2,565,702 (US dollars).
Data theft and other online threats  presently represent a significant danger for businesses in the UK.  Compounding this problem is the economic downturn, which is leading many  executives to cancel, defer or downsize security budgets. 
To  highlight the risks facing companies today, Astaro has compiled the  following list detailing the five most serious internet security holes.
1.      Browser vulnerabilities
No provider is immune to the  security holes that keep appearing in web browsers. A recent example is  the CSS bug that affected Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8  (CVE-2010-3962). This bug targets the computers in a two-stage attack:  First, the user follows an e-mail link to a web page containing  malicious code. This code is then run without the user realizing it and  automatically installs a trojan on the computer. The user does not need  to click the mouse; simply visiting the website is enough. The only way  companies can protect themselves fully from this is to refrain from  using any browsers with current known security holes for as long as they  remain unpatched. 
2.     Vulnerabilities in Adobe PDF Reader,  Flash, Java
The ubiquity of tools and programs such as Adobe PDF  Reader, Flash, and Java makes them highly vulnerable to attack. Although  they do frequently show security holes, most providers are quick to  provide patches. However, companies then have to make sure these patches  are installed on all computers - which is where they often fall down.  Either the IT departments are not aware of the patches, are unable to  install them, or bemoan the fact that the update failed. In this case,  if an employee visits a page with embedded Flash videos that launch  automatically, malicious code can then be run automatically in the  background. With the user being completely unaware of it, a trojan will  infiltrate the computer unnoticed, making it part of a botnet. 
While  there are only a few Windows exploits, for instance, there is a vast  number in Adobe, Java, and Flash. Flash and Java, in particular, have  become veritable malware disseminators over the past few months,  providing the perfect access point for trojans lurking in the background  of colorful websites, which then bypass all virus scanners to become  permanently ensconced on the computer. Private users should therefore  never use these programs and companies should employ standard procedures  or policies prohibiting their use. To prevent attacks via Flash,  companies can use Flash blockers (a browser plug-in) to prevent videos  from being played automatically.
3.     Vulnerabilities in Web  2.0 applications
The latest web-based security holes of note tend  to be new methods of attack, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL  Injection. The cause of the vulnerability in this case is generally  inaccurate or incorrect implementation of AJAX, a method for exchanging  data asynchronously between server and browser. This type of  vulnerability was exploited, for example, by the MySpace worm created by  the hacker known as Samy. It was published around a year ago and  allowed the hacker to swiftly obtain and access the profiles of millions  of MySpace contacts. Another, more recent attack was the "on mouse  over" attack on Twitter. This attack was particularly sophisticated  because its authors were able to embed malicious code that disseminated  itself and directed users to websites containing malware in just 140  characters and without any clicking required. All the user had to do was  move the cursor over the Tweet. There is very little users of such  applications can do to protect themselves against this other than to  stop using the service as soon as a security problem is made public. It  is therefore the manufacturers' responsibility to ensure that their  applications are well and securely programmed – or to take the  precautionary measure of protecting the data of its users with a Web  Application Firewall.
4.     Cell phone and smartphone data  security holes
In the UK alone, there are currently more mobile  phones than people. This very fact means that new data security risks  are being discovered in this arena on a daily basis. For instance, there  is a new generation of worms specifically targeted at smartphones  (let's call them "iWorms"). In September, it was discovered that the  ZeuS botnet was specifically attacking cell phones. Using infected HTML  forms on the victim's browser, it would obtain their cell number and  then send a text message containing the new malware SymbOS/Zitmo.A!tr  (for "Zeus In The Mobile") to this number. The malware, which was  designed to intercept and divert banking transactions, would then  install itself in the background.
Many Apple users wishing to  circumvent SIM card restrictions to a specific network provider or to  use applications that are unavailable through the Apple store perform a  process known as jailbreaking to remove the usage and access limitations  imposed by Apple. This process allows users to gain root access to the  command line of their device's operating system. The risk inherent with  jailbreaking is that it makes many of the devices more vulnerable to  attack; for instance, the majority of users do not change the SSH  password after performing a jailbreak – this is a serious failing  because Apple's default root password "alpine" is now widely known. If  the password is not changed, the device is susceptible to unauthorized  third-party access.
5.     Zero-day exploits in operating systems
Zero-day  attack is the term given to a threat that uses vulnerabilities that are  unknown to others and for which there is no patch. In other words, the  manufacturer of a system first becomes aware of the vulnerability on the  actual day of the attack - or even later. This gives hackers the  perfect opportunity to exploit holes. This type of operating system  attack is particularly dangerous because the cyber criminals have direct  remote access to the affected systems. They require no additional tools  such as browsers or Java, the only requirement is that the target  computer is online. There is no way to protect against zero-day exploits  because patches and first-aid measures can only be published  retroactively. It is not only Microsoft computers that are affected by  this problem; the growing prevalence of Macs means that they are also  becoming a target for zero-day attacks.
