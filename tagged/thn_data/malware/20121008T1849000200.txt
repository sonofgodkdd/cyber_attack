The executable installs a variant of the Dorkbot worm (also known as NRGbot), which appears to initiate large scale click-fraud activity on each compromised machine as well as recruiting it into a botnet. The Dorkbot variant infects the machine with ransomware that locks the user out and encrypts their files, before going on to charge them $200 to unlock the machine.
Ransomware is becoming an increasingly common tool in cyber criminals arsenal.
