Official Warns : US Also Vulnerable to Stuxnet Virus !

The computer virus Stuxnet, which some experts believe was created  specifically to target Iran's  nuclear facilities, could also threaten U.S. infrastructure, a senior  Department of Homeland Security official says.
"That virus  focused on specific software implementations, and those software  implementations did exist in some U.S. infrastructure," Greg Schaffer,  the department's assistant secretary for cybersecurity and  communications, told reporters at a breakfast Monday morning. "So, there  was the potential for some U.S. infrastructure.to be impacted at some  level."
Schaffer described Stuxnet as a "very tiered, complex and  sophisticated virus" that has attracted worldwide attention because it  very specifically targeted supervisory control and data acquisition, or  SCADA, systems at Siemens plants, including in Iran. Experts have said  that the cost and manpower required to create such a virus seem to  indicate that a government, rather than a rogue hacker or criminal gang,  was behind the virus' creation.
Still, Schaffer downplayed the  overall threat of Stuxnet within the United States. "There was some  risk, because those software packages exist within the U.S. ecosystem,"  he said. "But it's not clear there are any particular process within the  United States that would have triggered the software."
Despite  widespread speculation that Stuxnet was created to target Iran's Bushehr  nuclear plant, there has been little solid evidence to back up that  claim. Bruce Schneier is among the security experts who have expressed  skepticism, pointing to evidence that Stuxnet had spread to other  countries, like India. "By allowing Stuxnet to spread globally, its  authors committed collateral damage worldwide," Schneier  wrote. "From a foreign policy perspective, that seems dumb."
That  Stuxnet may not have meant to target U.S. systems doesn't mean that  facilities in the United States are safe from the virus. "One of the  tricks about any piece of malware is it doesn't necessarily stay in the  form in which it was released," Schaffer said, noting that such software  can be manipulated by others as it spreads.
He declined, however, to speculate on who or what was the original  target of Stuxnet. 
Even if Stuxnet wasn't targeting U.S.  infrastructure, its creation signifies a new wave of cyberattacks --  viruses and malware that are designed to attack infrastructure, such as  power-generating facilities. "This is no longer a world where malicious  defacements of Web pages is what we are focused on as a department or  government," Schaffer said. "We are worried about more sophisticated  attacks; we are worried about migration to things of value."
Stuxnet,  Shaffer says, is simply more evidence of such attacks targeting  physical infrastructure.
"Those," he said, "are the kinds of  things that give us pause."
