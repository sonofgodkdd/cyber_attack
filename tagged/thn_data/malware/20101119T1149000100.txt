Recently Sophos launched its free Mac  anti-virus for home users which now has 150,000 active users and  Sophos has analyzed the most commonly encountered malware that Mac users  are seeing.
The top 20 most commonly detected malware from just under 50,000 malware  reports between November 2nd and November 16th 2010 are listed below:
 Mal/ASFDldr-A - 4.62%
Troj/Javadl-V - 3.67%
Mal/JavaKC-G - 2.96%
Mal/JavaKC-E - 2.36%
Troj/KeygenD-P - 1.59%
Mal/JavaHU-A - 1.36%
Mal/JavaK-CI - 1.35%
Troj/JavaDL-X - 1.21%
Troj/Bytever-G - 1.11%
Mal/JavaHibis-A - 1.06%
Mal/JavaK-CK - 1.03%
OSX/Jahlav-C - 0.98%
Troj/JavaDL-J - 0.96%
OSX/DNSCha-E - 0.95%
Mal/Javasnd-C - 0.91%
Macl/Conficker-A - 0.80%
Troj/JavaDL-W - 0.76%
Many of the threats detected are Windows-specific threats that do not  attack Mac OS X directly, but can be transferred by Mac machines to  other platforms.
However, this list also shows some Mac OS X-specific Trojans, that are  typically disguised by hackers on BitTorrent sites, or planted on  websites as alluring downloads or plugins to view videos, and  platform-independent Java attacks.
"Mac users can no longer afford to keep their heads in the sand when it  comes to protecting their machines," said Graham Cluley, senior  technology at Sophos.
"So long as Mac users don't properly defend themselves, they will  increasingly be perceived as a soft target by cybercriminals and we will  therefore see the volume of Mac-specific malware continue to rise.   It's reassuring that we've been receiving feedback from users who were  surprised to find malware on their beloved Macs. Hopefully, more and  more Mac users will start to realise that security isn't just an issue  for PC users and they will start to take more measures to protect their  computers."
