Why You Should Enroll In Cyber Security Awareness Training
Wang Wei

When it comes to cyber security, even big organizations lack the basic knowledge of how to protect company’s data from the outside.
Everyday businesses are facing the threat of phishing, ransomware, data breaches and malware attacks that not only results in millions of dollars losses, but also damaged the reputations.
A new study shows that five out of six of the most serious IT security threats directly relate to phishing or the aftermath of a successful phishing attack.

SEA, short for Syrian Electronic Army, is famous for its advanced phishing attack capabilities and with the help of the same technique they fooled many popular organizations, social media and news media, including Twitter, Microsoft, Skype, Forbes, eBay and Paypal.
 Where do we lack?
According to the annual Verizon Data Breach Investigations report, about 58% of cyber security incidents were caused by employees, either due to failure in handling data or approving malicious data.
So, in order to cope up with online threats, individuals need to know how to deal with different kinds of Internet threats such as how to identify phishing emails sent by hackers, how to know which software applications are "safe" to install. And…
…this is where your company’s employees and, according to me, every individual need a good Cyber Security Awareness training program that can educate them.
