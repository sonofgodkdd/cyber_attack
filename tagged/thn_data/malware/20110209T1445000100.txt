Web Content Filtering
Content may be filtered by category or by blocking specific websites via blacklisting or by allowing specific websites via white listing.

Not surprisingly, the top ten most blocked categories are focused on providing a safer Internet experience for students and children, and a more work-appropriate environment for businesses. Percentages indicate the proportion of networks using category blocking that reference a given category.

Top Ten Blacklisted Websites
Blacklists are typically used when there is no desire to block an entire category in principle, but there is a focus on preventing traffic to specific websites based on a combination of their popularity and content. This top ten list suggests a concern with the use of bandwidth by streaming sites and with privacy concerns from advertising networks.
Percentages indicate the proportion of networks using blacklisting that reference a given site.

2. MySpace.com — 9.9%

10. Playboy.com — 1.2%
Top Ten Whitelisted Websites
Whitelists are typically used when there is a desire to block entire categories, but access to selected websites is granted on an exception basis. These sites represent the most trusted sites in their category. The fact that many of the same sites that appear on the Top Ten Blacklisted Websites list appear on the list below may indicate the diverse perspectives people have regarding many of these sites. Percentages indicate the proportion of networks using whitelisting that reference a given site.
YouTube.com — 12.7%

Filtering by Business Users
Businesses have specific goals in mind when blocking websites. They need to ensure compliance with HR policies, while also increasing worker productivity by preventing what they consider to be employee cyber slacking. This list shows that businesses are concerned with singling out popular sites considered to be of little value in a work setting, especially if they consume a lot of bandwidth. Percentages indicate proportion of business networks using blacklisting feature that reference a given site.

Phishing
OpenDNS created and runs PhishTank®, the free community Web site where anyone can submit, verify, track and share phishing data. Launched in October 2006 to coincide with National Cyber Security Awareness Month, the site employs a sophisticated voting system that requires the community to vote “phish” or “not phish,” reducing the possibility of false positives and improving the overall breadth and coverage of the phishing data. Today, PhishTank is the most important phishing database available and is used by the world’s largest companies. More than 1 million phishes have been submitted and voted on by the PhishTank community of researchers, academics and security experts.
