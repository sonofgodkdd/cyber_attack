Missouri university : Former students charged for hacking !
Mohit Kumar
Two former University of Central Missouri students have been charged  with hacking university databases, stealing and trying to profit from  the sale of confidential information.
Joseph Camp and Daniel  Fowler were both indicted by a federal grand jury. The pair allegedly  developed a computer virus and distributed it through email attachments  and USB flash drives.
In all, they breached the personal data of  about 90,000 UCM students, faculty, staff and alumni. Camp and Fowler  then tried to sell the information for $35,000.
The seven-count  indictment also charges them with trying to steal university funds and  using Facebook accounts to threaten potential witnesses. The charges  carry possible prison sentences of between two and 10 years.
"The  duo used Fowler's room as their base and over a three-month period  between October and December 2009 broke into numerous university  databases and computers - including one belonging to a university  administrator," according to a Computerworld report. Both were enrolled  in the school at the time of the attacks.
For companies and  organizations, the case highlights the need for data-leak prevention  measures, such as tight email  security that includes an anti-spam  filter to help protect against a malware infection.
According to  the Kansas City Star, U.S. Attorney Beth Phillips has praised the  university's data-leak prevention measures that allowed it to "thwart"  the pair from profiting from the scheme.
Camp and Fowler  monitored systems infected with their virus, recorded keystrokes, stole  data and could even control a computer's webcam.
In one instance,  they reportedly hacked a residence hall director's credentials to  transfer university funds into their student accounts, according to  Computerworld. They did this on 30 occasions with transfer amounts  ranging from $50 to $4,300, according to the federal indictment.
Many  of the pair's hacks were perpetrated over the 2009 Thanksgiving holiday  break in an attempt to avoid detection.
Authorities arrested  Camp in New York after recording conversations he had with someone  identified only as T.S., the person the pair were trying to sell the  stolen information to. When he was arrested, Camp had four Excel  spreadsheets that contained the breached information.
Companies  and organizations have to constantly be on the lookout for sophisticated  attacks, such as the one in the UCM case that combined thumb drives and  email attacks. According to a recent data protection trends report, an  email solutions vendor predicts such blended attacks will be more common  in 2011.
