Android Malware uses Google Cloud Messaging Service; infected over 5 Million Devices
Anonymous
The Kaspersky Lab researchers recently have discovered a number of Android malware apps are abusing the Google  Cloud Messaging Service (GCM) as Command and Control server. The GCM  service allows Android app developers to send messages using JSON  Format for installed apps, but hackers exploited it for malicious  Purposes.
Using Google Cloud Messaging Service (GCM) as Command and Control server for Android Malware is not a new concept, as last year Security researcher and Hacker 'Mohit Kumar' demonstrated 'Android Malware Engine' - One of the Most Sophisticated Android malware during Malcon conference.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The Kaspersky Lab researchers have detected at least five  Different Android Trojans that used JSON format:1. SMS.AndroidOS.FakeInst.a
2. SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.ao
3. SMS.AndroidOS.OpFake.a
4. Backdoor.AndroidOS.Maxit.a
5. SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.az.
The authors of the malware in  Every case took advantage of Google Cloud Messaging Service  to  Exchange messages between C&C services and the malicious app. Once  Gained a Google Cloud Messaging Service (GCM) ID, malware updates are distributed exploiting directly the Google cloud services and also any  Command to the malicious agent is sent is exploiting the service and using  JSON format.
Google Cloud Messaging Service (GCM) act as Command and Control server for the Trojans, which makes the malware updates as the official  Updates via Google.
“Furthermore,  The execution of commands received from the Google Cloud Messaging Service  GCM is performed by the GCM system and it is impossible to block them  Directly on an infected device. The only way to cut this channel off  From virus writers is to block developer accounts with IDs linked to the  Registration of malicious programs.”
SMS.AndroidOS.FakeInst.a  Is the most diffused agent, according Kaspersky experts more than  4,800,000 installers have been detected and around 160000 attempted  Installation was blocked in 2012.
“It  Can send text messages to premium numbers, delete incoming text  Messages, generate shortcuts to malicious sites, and display  Notifications advertising other malicious programs that are spread under  The guise of useful applications or games” states the Kaspersky blog Post.
SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.ao  is presented as a porn app and has the primary intent to send messages  to premium numbers, meanwhile the SMS.AndroidOS.OpFake.a malware is the typical SMS malicious application of which have been detected also more than 1 million installers.
This last malware is also able to steal  Sensitive information from the victim's handset such as  contacts and it is also able to self-update its code, the agent appeared very active  And was detected in 97 different countries, the majority in Russia and  Eastern countries.
The Kaspersky team has blocked more than 60,000  Attempted installs, it sends several commands from both the GCM and its  Own C&C servers such as:Sending premium text messages to a specified number
Sending text messages
Performing self-updates
Stealing text messages
Deleting incoming text messages that meet the criteria set by the C&C
Theft of contacts
Replacing the C&C or GCM numbers
Stopping or restarting its operations
Backdoor.AndroidOS.Maxit trojan was very dated, first instance was detected in late 2011 and  Appears to be continuously updated, today the experts counted more than  40 different variants most often in Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines  And Burma.
“All of  These modifications are very similar to one another,” “the app opens  Websites with games, while malicious operations are executed in the  Background.” It has been found most often in Malaysia, but also in  Thailand, the Philippines and Burma.
"The  The first thing the backdoor sets out to do is collect information about  The phone and the SIM card, including the phone number and the mobile  Provider. All of this data is uploaded to the androidproject.imaxter.net  C&C. This is the server that manages all of the Trojan’s primaries  Functions."
The  Last trojan, SMS.AndroidOS.Agent.az., was detected for the first time in  May 2012 and is a shell app for a Vietnamese porn website which is able  Also to send text messages to a premium number.
The number of malware that exploits the Google Cloud Messaging Service is  Destined to increase despite it is still relatively low, the data on  Their diffusion demonstrated it. These malware are prevalent in Western  Europe, the CIS, and Asia, virus writers know very well that execution  Off commands received from GCM is performed by the Google Cloud Messaging  Service system and it is impossible to block them directly on an  Infected device.
Actually  The only option for security experts is to block developer accounts  With IDs linked to the registration of malicious applications.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
