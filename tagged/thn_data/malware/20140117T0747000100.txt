Wang Wei
I hope you all still remember the famous and powerful Remote Administration Tool (RAT) called 'Dark Comet', developed by a French computer geek 'Jean-Pierre Lesueur', also known as 'DarkCoderSc'.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); 
However, He had closed the Dark Comet project, when the Syrian government found to be using it to track down and to spy on their people. After that DarkCoderSc started working under a new banner 'Phrozen Software' to develop many new security softwares and penetration testing tools.
Just yesterday, Jean-Pierre and his team-mate Fabio Pinto from French University, have released a new tool called 'Rakabulle', a file binder with some cool features for penetration testers and malware researchers.
File binder is an application that allows a user to bind multiple files together, resulting in a single executable file. When you execute that single application, all previous merged files will be extracted to a temporary location, and will be executed normally."The builder Rakabulle application will create a stub and inject in its resource the target files to extract and execute. The stub is the little generate part of the program which is designed to extract from its resource the target files to a temporary location and execute. In our application the stub also got a part to inject in Explorer or Internet Explorer process and load custom made plugins.Video Demo:
