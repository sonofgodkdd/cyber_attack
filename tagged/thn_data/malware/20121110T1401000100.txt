It's be Just hours Windows Phone 8 has been released - and hackers have already dished out a malware prototype for the platform. Windows Phone 8 is the second generation of the Windows Phone mobile operating system. 
Windows Phone 8 Microsoftâ€™s latest in mobile OS technology - comes in as a direct competition to rivals Apple and Google. The research firm Gartner indicates that by 2016 the increase in Windows Phone users will slightly fall below Apple`s iOS users.
To be showcased at the International Malware Conference, MalCon - on 24th November in India, the prototype has been created by Shantanu Gawde, who has previously created a malware that utilized the famed Xbox Kinect.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Windows Phone 8 replaces its previously Windows CE-based architecture with one based on the Windows NT kernel with many components shared with Windows 8, allowing applications to be easily ported between the two platforms.
While no further details of the malware are available at this point of time, it will be only time before attackers target the platform aggressively to invade users privacy. The research also stresses on that fact that enterprise adoption of mobile security solutions must be taken very seriously as it may have significant impact on business.
The prototype will be shared by the MalCon conference with Anti-virus vendors to help them mitigate similar attacks to an extent.
