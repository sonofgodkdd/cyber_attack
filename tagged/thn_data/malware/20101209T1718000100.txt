Stuxnet Worm May Be in your Computer !
Mohit Kumar
Stuxnet is a virus that was specifically designed to attack supervisory control and data acquisition systems manufactured by German industrial giant Siemens. These systems are often utilized to manage water supplies, power plants and other industrial facilities, making the worm especially dangerous for governments.
Who Wrote this ProgramExperts in the cyber security field have speculated that Stuxnet may  have been created by a government or a well-financed group of investors,  as the worm is too complex to have been developed by a single hacker.  The fact that the virus has done much of its damage in Iran has caused  many experts to question whether Stuxnet was designed to sabotage the  country’s nuclear facilities. 
Cyber-Attacks Getting More SophisticatedEven if Stuxnet wasn’t targeting U.S. infrastructure, its creation  signifies a new wave of cyberattacks, viruses and malware that are  designed to attack infrastructure, such as power-generating facilities.  This is no longer a world where malicious defacement of Web pages is  what we are focused on as a department or government. We need to become  worried about more sophisticated attacks; we are worried about migration  to things of value.
Can Stuxnet Get Into Home Computers“Aurora had a zero-day, but it was a zero-day against [Internet  Explorer version 6],” he said. “Here you have a vulnerability, which is  effective against every version of Windows since Windows 2000.” Recall,  Microsoft no longer supports Windows 2000 and other older versions still  heavily used in ICS applications. Stuxnet can use MS08-067, the same  vulnerability used by Downadup (a.k.a. Conficker) to spread. MS08-067 is  a critical vulnerability in the Windows Server Service on Windows  2008/Vista/2003/XP/2000 computers, which allows hackers to gain remote  control of the affected computer with the same privileges as a logged on  user.
Patches, Fixes, Antivirus AvailableStuxnet is an attack on physical processes, which means it is not  “patchable.” Given a sophisticated cyber attack targeted at ICSs, there  is little chance the ICS community will be able to detect it. IT malware  researchers have the best chance of finding it. The ICS community needs  to meet them and work with them. For Stuxnet, the ICS community needs  to understand how to detect the infection so as to know whether to trust  the control systems.
The only advice that seems to make any sense as far as this virus goes  is to have back-up plans ready if your system is impacted.
