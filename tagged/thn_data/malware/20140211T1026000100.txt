Security Researchers at Anti virus firm - Trend Micro discovered various Valentine's Day threats which are common at such occasion i.e. A flower-delivery service and it appears to be a normal promotional e-mail, but the links actually lead to various survey scams.
The Malware threats also arrive during this season of love. The researchers recently found a new attack targeting Canadian users looking for a Romantic Dinner Giveaway. The email appears to be about a special Valentine Dinner, and has an attachment which is actually a malicious .RTF file (detected as TROJ_ARTIEF. VDY), using a known buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2012-0158)  in Windows Common Controls, allows remote code execution to drop a backdoor (BKDR_INJECT.VDY) onto the affected system.

The researchers have detected various malware-inflicted apps, one of which is ‘Valentine’s Day 2014 Wallpaper.’ The app records user’s location and his browsing history in the process without having any justification for asking permissions.
Another is ‘Valentine's Day Frames’, the app that reads the user’s contacts list, which is logically an odd request because the app is only intended to adorn user’s romantic photographs with Valentine's Day themed photo frames. So what’s the use of reading your contact list for this app?
