Old security holes bigger threat, says TrustWave
Mohit Kumar

An overemphasis on tackling new and emerging security threats may be  causing companies to overlook older but far more frequently exploited  vulnerabilities, says a recent report.
The report, from TrustWave, is based on an analysis of data gathered  from over 1900 penetration tests and over 200 data breach investigations  conducted on behalf of clients such as American Express, MasterCard,  Discover, Visa and several large retailers.
The analysis showed is that major global companies are employing  "vulnerability chasers" and searching out the latest vulnerabilities and  zero-day threats while overlooking the most common ones, the report  said.
                 Trustwave buys Breach Security                As a result, companies continue to be felled by old and supposedly  well understood vulnerabilities rather than by newfangled attack tools  and methods.
For instance, the top three ways hackers gained initial access to  corporate networks in 2009 were via remote access applications, trusted  internal network connections and SQL injection attacks, TrustWave found.
All three attacks points have been well researched and known about  for several years. SQL injection vulnerabilities, for instance, have  been known about for at least 10 years, but still continue to be widely  prevalent in web-based, database-driven applications, TrustWave said.
The most common vulnerability that TrustWave discovered during its  external network penetration tests had to do with the management  interfaces for web application engines such as Websphere, and Cold  Fusion. In many cases, the management interfaces were accessible  directly from the Internet and had little or no password protection,  potentially allowing attackers to deploy their own malicious  applications on the web server.
Similarly unprotected network infrastructure components such as  routers, switches and VPN concentrators represented the second most  common vulnerability unearthed by TrustWave. The tendency by many  companies to host internal applications on the same server that also  hosts external content was another common vulnerability, as were  misconfigured firewall rules, default or easy-to-guess passwords and DNS  cache poisoning.
Meanwhile TrustWave's wireless penetration tests unearthed common  weaknesses such as the continued use of WEP encryption, legacy 802.11  networks with minimal to no security controls and wireless clients using  public "guest" networks instead of secured private networks.
In almost all of the cases, the most common vulnerabilities unearthed  by TrustWave were common well understood issues that should have been  addressed a long time ago said Nicholas Percoco, senior vice president  at TrustWave's SpiderLabs research unit.
"There are basically two themes," Percoco said. "Through our study in  2009 we found some very old vulnerabilities present within enterprises,  some as old as 20 to 30 years." The second theme is that attackers are  targeting these old flaws to break into enterprises, then using  increasingly sophisticated tools to harvest data from companies, he  said.
In addition to older keystroke logging and packet sniffing tools,  malicious attackers are increasingly employing tools such as memory  parsers and credentialed malware to steal data, Percoco said. Memory  parsers are used to monitor the random access memory associated with a  certain process and to extract specific data from it. Credentialed  malware programs are a new class of multi-user programs that have  typically been used to steal money and payment card numbers from ATMs.
There are several measures companies can take to mitigate the risks  posed by older and often overlooked vulnerabilities, TrustWave said. One  step is to maintain a complete asset inventory. Many companies are  often unaware of all the IT assets they own or of the risks they pose to  data, so maintaining an up to date list of assets is vital to  protecting them, TrustWave said.
Decommissioning older legacy systems as much as possible can also  help mitigate the risk. Also, in 80% of the cases that TrustWave looked  at, third-parties were responsible for introducing vulnerabilities. So  monitoring third-party relationships is key according to the company.  Other recommended measures included internal network segmentation, data  encryption and stronger Wi-Fi security policies.
