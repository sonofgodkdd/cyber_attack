Recent disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden claiming that internet traffic is being intercepted and used by the Americans in their war on terror, force to re-think about the user's privacy and online anonymity.

It has been relatively common knowledge for years that wherever we go on the web, we leave clear tracks, so it shouldn't really have come as much of a surprise to discover this has been going on.
The best thing you can do to stay anonymous online is to hide your IP address. If someone knows your IP address, it is the easiest way to trace your online activity back to you and they can easily determine the geographic location of the server that hosts that address and get a rough idea of where you're located.
TOR is a network of virtual tunnels that allows people and groups to improve their privacy and security on the Internet. Browsing with TOR is a lot like simultaneously using hundreds of different proxies that are randomized periodically.
Tor Browser Bundle includes its own version of Firefox to preserve anonymity, but plugins such as Flash don't work with the bundle. For Malware analysts never want to disclose their IP address/Location while testing the Malware samples, or for analysis or communicating with command-and-control servers, TOR is not enough.
Tortilla creator Jason Geffner 
CrowdStrike researcher Jason Geffner released an open source free new tool, called Tortilla, a new tool to securely, anonymously, and transparently route all TCP/IP and DNS traffic through Tor, regardless of the client software, and without relying on VPNs or additional hardware or virtual machines.
This new tool also supports Flash and other plug-ins, and doesn't require additional hardware or virtual machines. Jason released Tortilla at Black Hat Conference this year. Online Activists, Hackers and Bad people also love anonymity, which means the Tortilla Tool is ideal for those not wanting to be tracked or overheard.
