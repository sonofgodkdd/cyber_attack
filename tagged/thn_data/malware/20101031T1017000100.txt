FBI Arrest Over 100, Uncovers Cyber Crime Ring
Mohit Kumar

The FBI announced last week that it had busted a major international  cyber crime network after arresting more than 90 suspected members of  the ring in the US alone. The FBI said that the suspects worked as  so-called mules for hackers, who were based in Eastern Europe and used  malware to hack US computers and succeeded in stealing around $70m. Some  people were detained in Ukraine and the UK as well.
FBI said in its statement that the hackers stole money from the bank  accounts of small companies, municipalities, churches and other victims  in the U.S. “This was a major theft ring,” said FBI Assistant Director  Gordon Snow, of the bureau’s cyber division, in a statement. “Global  criminal activity on this scale is a threat to our financial  infrastructure, and it can only be effectively countered through the  kind of international cooperation we have seen in this case.”
FBI officials said the arrests were part of "one of the largest cyber  criminal cases we have ever investigated". A US Attorney said that the  people arrested in the US have been charged with conspiracy to commit  bank fraud and money laundering. The FBI added that the hackers were  planning to steal around $220 million.
The operation to nab these international hackers kicked off in Omaha in  May last year when FBI agents noticed a row of suspicious bank  transactions. Officials from the US, Ukraine, the Netherlands and the UK  were involved in the investigation. The hackers used malware contained  in seemingly benign e-mails to the victims to carry out their  activities.
