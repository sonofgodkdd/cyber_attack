This application allows us to remotely access the entire victim’s personal information and even though the confidential data available in the android cell phone.

This application can also allow the attacker to remotely delete the data available on the victim’s phone. In order to perfectly work this application you have to gain access to the victim’s android cell phone for at least 20 seconds. You have to install the application and then restart the cell phone. After restart your application gets automatically started on the victim’s cell phone. Now you can access the victim’s cells information for any normal cell phone and get the response on it. The android spy agent will be hidden in the victim’s cell phone and not allows the victim to easily uninstall or delete it from the cell.

We will give an inside view on how the black hat underground uses this, to earn 5-6 digit income per month . For this, We will start off by creating an Android Malware, and then will gradually move on to the Botnet Part.", Aditya Gupta said.
Maintaining that a wide variety of services are being offered on the mobile platforms without proper security implementation, Anurag Kumar Jain and Devendra Shanbhag from Tata Consultancy Services will deliberate on the topic, "Mobile Application Security Risk and Remediation".
