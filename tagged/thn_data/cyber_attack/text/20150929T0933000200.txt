The news comes just a few months after the third and last founder of Pirate Bay Fredrik Neij (also known asÂ TiAMO) was released from a Swedish prison after serving his 10-month prison sentence.
Svartholm has not yet made any public statements following his release from a Swedish prison on Saturday. His release was reported by Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter. 
However, the release was confirmed by Warg's mother Kristina Svartholm on Twitter.
"Yes, #anakata is free now. No more need to call for #freeanakata. Thank you everyone for your important support during these three years!"
Svartholm was arrested in his Cambodian apartment in September 2012, and extradited to Sweden in November 2013, where he served charges for copyright theft. In November 2013, he was finally extradited to Denmark to face charges in the CSC hacking cases.
Once the world's most popular file-sharing website, The Pirate Bay predominantly used to share copyrighted material, such as pirated software, video files and other stuff, free of charge.
Despite the criminal convictions and numerous takedowns in police raids, the Pirate Bay continues to operate, although it has moved to different Web domains several times.
