A widespread government internet filter prevents Iranians from accessing many sites on the official grounds they are offensive or criminal.
Ramezanali Sobhani-Fard, the head of parliament's information and communications technology committee said, "Within the last few days illegal VPN ports in the country have been blocked. Only legal and registered VPNs can from now on be used."
Registered and legal VPN access can still be purchased, but the typical filter workarounds no longer work.
