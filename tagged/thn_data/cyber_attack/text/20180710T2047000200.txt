This month there is no critical vulnerability patched in Microsoft Windows operating system and surprisingly, none of the flaw patched by the tech giant this month is listed as publicly known or under active attack.
Critical Flaws Patched In Microsoft Products
Most of the critical issues are memory corruption flaws in IE, Edge browser and Chakra scripting engine, which if successfully exploited, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a targeted system in the context of the current user.
"If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights," Microsoft explains.
One of these critical flaws (CVE-2018-8327), reported by researchers at Casaba Security, also affects PowerShell Editor Services that could allow a remote attacker to execute malicious code on a vulnerable system.
