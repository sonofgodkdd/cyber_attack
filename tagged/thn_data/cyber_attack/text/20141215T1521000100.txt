Hemsworth's character in the upcoming cyber thriller is a former Blackhat hacker, named Nicholas Hathaway, who is serving a 15-year sentence for cyber crimes. He was recruited straight from prison by a mixed team of American and Chinese law enforcement officials to stop high-level cybercrime network from Chicago to Los Angeles to Hong Kong to Jakarta and save the world from global hackers.
