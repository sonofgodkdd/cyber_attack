People around the country reported on social media that they had problems accessing the site around midday and continuing into the evening. Some reported not being able to log in to online banking for hours.
"We are working to ensure full availability," Mark Pipitone, a bank spokesman told.Â Asked whether the bank was the target of a cyberattack, Pipitone said, "I can assure you we continuously take proactive measures to secure our systems."
The U.S. government has denounced the film repeatedly since a riot in Libya last week killed the U.S. ambassador to the country and three other Americans.
