50 million customers compromised in LivingSocial hack
Mohit Kumar

LivingSocial, a daily deals website part-owned by Amazon Inc., hit by a cyber attack that may have affected more than 50 million customers and will need to reset their passwords. LivingSocial says it has 70 million members worldwide.

Leaked data includes names, e-mail addresses, dates of birth and encrypted passwords. Customers' credit card information and merchants' financial and banking information were not affected by the hack, LivingSocial said. So it looks like some personal info may have fallen into the wrong hands, but credit card and other financial details should be safe.
The cyberattack affected LivingSocial customers in North America, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Ireland and Malaysia and its LetsBonus users in Southern Europe and Latin America.
So if you’re among the affected users, the hackers have just the right amount of information to phish you. The site is sending out emails to customers advising them to change their passwords.
