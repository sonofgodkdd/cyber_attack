US CERT warn about Some Samsung printers, including models the Korean company made for Dell, have a backdoor administrator account coded into their firmware.
This hard coded admin account in firmware could enable attackers to change their configuration, read their network information or stored credentials and access sensitive information passed to them by users.

Even if SNMP is disabled, this "backdoor administrator account" is still active and could be used by an attacker to access the printer. SNMP is an Internet protocol commonly used to monitor and read statistics from network-attached devices.
US-CERT did not provide a list with the exact printer models affected by the issue, but said that, according to Samsung, models released after Oct. 31, 2012, are not vulnerable. As for the Dell model, Samsung builds Dell printers such as the B1160w modeled after Samsung's ML-2165W compact all-in-one printer. It's unclear what other Dell branded printers may be affected.
