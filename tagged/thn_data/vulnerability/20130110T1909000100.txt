The creator of Blackhole, who uses the nickname 'Paunch,' announced yesterday on several Under web forums that the Java zero-day was a 'New Year's Gift,' to customers who use his exploit kit. Vulnerability was later confirmed by security firm AlienVault Labs, "On the other hand we expect a Metasploit module in the upcoming days as it has been happening during the last year as well as most of the exploit kits adopting this new zeroday sooner than later."
Last option for readers, deactivate the Java plugin in their browsers without delay.
