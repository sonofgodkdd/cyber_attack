Yesterday, we report about the security breach in US Government computers belongs to NASA restricted area website and Hacker dump out the complete source code and files from server of the website.
Today another hacker claim a quick XSS (Cross site scripting) Vulnerability in NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory website (http://onearth.jpl.nasa.gov/) via a pastebin note.
Hacker is going by name "Antraxt Hacker" and said about vulnerability exposure that,"I just want to proof that NASA is and never will be secured as human kind thinks they are".
The xss vulnerable link is disclosed in pastebin note. I feel this not a offensive hack by hacker, even NASA should take advantage of free of cost Penetration testing services from individual like , who even not looking for Bug Bounties.
