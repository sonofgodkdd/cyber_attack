KILL 'Find My iPhone' WITHOUT APPLE PASSWORD
Normally, disabling Find My iPhone requires Apple ID password, but according to the vulnerability reported by Miguel Alvarado, a thief can bypass all of this security feature without knowing your Apple account's password.
In a video demonstration on iOS 7, he explained that just by tapping the “Delete Account” in the iCloud settings panel and switch the “Find My iPhone” to off mode simultaneously, one can easily remove the iCloud account without any password authentication.
But doing so is not that much easy as it actually looks, a novice has to perform this a number of times to get this done.
