Samsung Galaxy S II (AT&T) trusted pattern lock Security Bypassed
Major security flaw found in AT&T's upcoming Samsung Galaxy S II device. Guys at BGR noticed that the information on the upcoming AT&T version of the Samsung Galaxy S II isn't so safe behind a once trusted pattern lock, and that it can quite simply be bypassed.
All you have to do : Wake the device using the lock key, then let the screen time out, then wake it again with the lock key and you can access all the data.
AT&T's Version of Samsung Galaxy S II is confirmed to have this security flaw, but the Sprint version or other does not suffer from this.Even I just check my own Samsung Galaxy S II (Indian Version), Yeah - ITS SAFE :)
