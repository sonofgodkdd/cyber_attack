Unlike the previous bugs it will not expose your Email, Photos, Facebook and Twitter but allows attackers to access your phone call history, voicemails and entire list of contacts.
A step by step guide released by iDownloadblog:

Click the FaceTime button
When the FaceTime App appears, click the Sleep button
Unlock the iPhone
Answer and End the FaceTime call at the other end

It would be easy for someone who knows you or your love partner or your business partner to obtain your phone and call themselves from it to take advantage of this trick and they may only gain access to the Phone app.
Fixing this bug is pretty simple, Disable the Siri in Lockscreen by navigating to “Settings –> General –> Passcode –> Siri” and disable it there.
