Over the past couple of weeks there has been a series of discussions around why the U.S defense and Intelligence agencies are moving so quickly to adopt cloud computing. Are there any Security Holes in their Security ? Or has someone already hacked them and their documents ?. In the last week we have noticed lots of hackers activity.

After reading all this I think everyone will be sure that, Nothing is Secure In this World ! We need more Secure Systems and Technology.
We can't say how much more access (sl1nk) has but this raises the question on Cyber Security !!
Cloud computing is unique in its ability to address these critical defense and intelligence mission needs. That’s why cloud computing is critical to our national defense. As a bonus, cloud computing offers DoD and Intelligence Community agencies the ability to increase efficiencies and incur marked cost savings during their life-cycles to alleviate some of the pressure of budget reductions. Moving IT operations to the cloud also will assist in enhanced collaboration.
Note : We are Presenting This Report, just to make aware the Security Experts that someone can and will get into their systems. Please Be carefull. THN is always a responsible news media and we raise our voice against injustice and we educate the world on cyber security issues.
