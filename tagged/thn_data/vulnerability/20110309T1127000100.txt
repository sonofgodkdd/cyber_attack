'EC-Council Academy' server compromised !
EC-Council Academy , Here a image show above that http://www.eccouncilacademy.org got rooted by a hacker. The image clear expose the shell on the server and via putty the hacker is login as root on their server :P
Update : I wanna clarify that 'EC-Council Academy' is not a part of 'EC-Council Organisation' , Actually in above image we have just shown that Academy's web hosting server had been compromised, it was not actually defaced by hacker.
"
I wish to clarify to our partners, clients and friends that the EC-Council Academy Sdn. Bhd. is neither a subsidiary, associate nor a sister concern of the International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants (EC-Council).EC-Council Academy is purely one of the 450 training locations EC-Council has in over 80 countries. However, it is officially sanctioned to use the EC-Council name as it is a licensee of EC-Council's training methodology. A recent hacking incident involving this outside group has led to some confusion within the industry, as a few people mistakenly believe it was our website that came under attack. That is not true and I wish to make it clear that the EC-Council was not involved in this matter. It is unfortunate that the web service provider of this entity was compromised that led to the the attack.EC-Council Academy is a separate, distinct company with no corporate connection between itself and EC-Council or EC-Council University.  " EC-Council President/Co-Founder Jay Bavisi said to 'The Hacker News' .
