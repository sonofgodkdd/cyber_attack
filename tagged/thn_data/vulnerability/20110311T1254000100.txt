Microsoft Windows Picture and Fax Viewer Library Vulnerability !
I. BACKGROUND
The Windows Picture and Fax Viewer "shimgvw.dll" library is used by Windows Explorer to generate thumbnail previews for media files.
II. DESCRIPTION
Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in multiple versions of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted host. 
An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the "shimgvw" library. During the processing of an image within a certain function, a bitmap containing a large "biWidth" value can be used to cause an integer calculation overflow. This condition can lead to the overflow of a heap buffer and may result in the execute arbitrary code on the targeted host.
III. ANALYSIS
Exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted host under the privileges of the current logged-on user. Successful exploitation would require the attacker to entice his or her victim into viewing a specially-crafted thumbnail leveraging the vulnerability. 
Some vectors of attack include e-mail, the browser and network shares. In an e-mail-based attack, the attacker must entice his or her victim into opening or previewing a specially-crafted Office document containing a specially-crafted thumbnail. In a browser-based attack, the victim must simply view a maliciously crafted website. In a network share attack, such as UNC or WebDAV, an attacker would require the victim to simply navigate to the folder containing the crafted thumbnail.
