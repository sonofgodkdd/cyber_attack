Hacker said ,"I've got to give some applause to all these pseudo-security technicians out there. I cut Intel a break, I have access to a database and another vulnerability which enables the right to read user data. I'll be gracious here and NOT spill the data, but I will provide screenshots to prove that I have access to Credit Card data and such."
The first vulnerability that will be disclosed is familiar to the Dell vulnerability that was found earlier this month, the vulnerability isn't critical and it can simply be used as a weapon to spill sensitive information. A smart user will get a target to register on this sub-domain, get the users email, replace it with the email that is already licensed, and get the target's information spilled.
For Example Visit Here,Â The vulnerability speaks for itself. The proof of Database Extracted is shown above. We are waiting for confirmation of this Hack from Intel Officials. Stay tuned !
