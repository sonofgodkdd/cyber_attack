Two Linux vulnerabilities to get root access
Mohit Kumar
Two new vulnerabilities affecting Linux were uncovered this week that could potentially be used by malicious  hackers to gain root privileges.One vulnerability, which was reported  on Tuesday by security firm VSR, arises from a flaw in the  implementation of the Reliable Datagram Sockets protocol (RDS) in  versions 2.6.30 through 2.6.36-rc8 of the Linux kernel.
Known as CVE-2010-3904,  the bug could allow a local attacker to issue specially crafted socket  function calls to write arbitrary values into kernel memory and thereby  escalate privileges to root, giving the attacker "superuser,"  administrator status.
The problem exists only in Linux  installations in which the CONFIG_RDS kernel configuration option is  set, and where there are no restrictions preventing unprivileged users  from loading packet family modules, "as is the case on most stock  distributions," VSR notes.
A proof-of-concept  exploit created by VSR demonstrates the severity of the  vulnerability. Heise Security tested the exploit on 64-bit Ubuntu  10.04 and was able to open a root shell, according to The  H.
A patch  has already been committed to the Linux kernel, and distributions  should soon be updated accordingly. Users should be sure to install any  updates to their Linux distribution or apply the committed patch and  recompile their kernel, VSR advised.
Alternatively, preventing  the RDS kernel module from loading is also an effective workaround, VSR  said. That can be achieved by executing the following command as root:  echo "alias net-pf-21 off" > /etc/modprobe.d/disable-rds
GNU C  Library Loader
The second vulnerability, dubbed CVE-2010-3847,  derives from a flaw in the library loader of the GNU C library that can  be exploited to gain root privileges under Linux and other systems.  Using the hole, an attacker could reportedly  gain full control of a system by escalating his or her privileges after  breaking into a web server with restricted access rights, for example.
Discovered and announced by Tavis Ormandy on Monday, the bug was  found to exist in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and CentOS 5, among  other distributions.Patches are currently in the works, but "this is a low impact  vulnerability that is only of interest to security professionals and  system administrators," Ormandy noted. "End  users do not need to be concerned."
In tests by Heise Security, a  64-bit installation of Ubuntu 10.04 appeared unaffected, The H  reported.
