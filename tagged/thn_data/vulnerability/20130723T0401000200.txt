According to Malik, The web server (DMCRUIS/0.1) installed on Smart TVs on port TCP/5600 can be crashed to reboot the device, if attacker will send a long HTTP GET request on TV's ip address.
Malik successfully tested the exploit on his Samsung PS50C7700 plasma TV, as shown in the video demonstration below:
In the Demo, The TV is connected by ethernet cable to a home network, and after running the exploit against TV's ip address - A few seconds later, the TV would restart and repeat the process.
This means that a potential attacker only needs to obtain access to the LAN that the TV has joined, in order to attack it. This can be done either by breaking into a wireless access point or by infecting a computer on the same network with malware.
Malik discovered the flaw on July 21st, 2013, published a proof-of-concept exploit on his website and vulnerability dubbed CVE-2013-4890.Â I think, now we need firewall or antivirus protection for our television set too.
Samsung did not immediately return a request for comment sent via email.
