Facebook "Trusted friends" Security Feature Easily Exploitable
Last week Facebook announced that in one day 600,000 accounts possibly get hacked. Another possible solution for Facebook to combat security issues is to find 3 to 5 "Trusted friends". Facebook will be adding two new security features that will allow users to regain control of their account if it gets hijacked.
In Facebook's case, the keys are codes, and the user can choose from three to five "Trusted friends" who are then provided with a code. If you ever get locked out of your account (and you can't access your email to follow the link after resetting your Facebook password), you gather all the codes and use them to gain access to it again. Yet This method is used by hackers to hack most of the Facebook account using little bit of Social Engineering from last 5-6 Months according to me. Let us know, how this works...
How its Exploitable:
This Exploit is 90% Successful on the victims who add friends without knowing them or just for increasing the number of Friends. This method to hack a Facebook Account only works if 3 trusted friends agree to give you the security code ! Another Idea, Why not Create 3 fake accounts and send Friend Request to Victim. Once your 3 Fake Accounts become friends with your victims facebook account, you can select those 3 Accounts to get the Security Code and Reset the password of Victim. Here a Complete Demonstration of Hacking Method on HackersOnlineClub.
