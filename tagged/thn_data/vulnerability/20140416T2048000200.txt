Successful exploitation also allows an attacker to manipulate certain local data on a system and can cause a DoS attack without the need of authentication credentials, which means the flaws can be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password to crashing an application or an entire system.
In the latest update, the vulnerability has been fixed in the current version of the “Java SE 8 Update 5" and to the newer release "Java SE 7 Update 55".
