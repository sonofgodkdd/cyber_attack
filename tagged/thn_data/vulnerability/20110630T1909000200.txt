Hackers Release Step by step proof about this Vulnerability
1. Website : www.googlelabs.com or labs.google.com
2. Vulnerability type : SQL Injection
3. Vulnerable url : http://www.googlelabs.com/?q=%27&apps=Search+Labs
4. Info:
Host IP: 209.85.175.141
Web Server: Google Frontend
Keyword Found: Fast
Injection type is Integer
Let’s Check Exploiting this Vulnerable link. Here Hackers use 3 Famous SQL Injection tools. They are:
1. Havij Advance SQL Injection Tool
2. Safe3 SQL Injector v8.4
3. Pangolin SQL Injection Tool
1st Work with Havij Advance SQL Injection Tool:
Screen Shot 1: Scan Vulnerable link and it says this website is Vulnerable.
Screen Shot 2: Now it scans and gets all tables and columns
Screen Shot 3: Now you can see list of tables and Columns
And this is a Prove for this Website is Genuine SQL Injection Vulnerable. Here you see this database type is MS Access, so this is a Proof of this concept. Some people should Say Google Lab Database System is not Ms Access but this Website Database is Similar as Ms Access database and Ms Access SQL Injection Query are also Work on Google Labs Database system. As like MySQL 5 and MySQL 4.1 both are injected via Union select, but both are not have Information Schema.
2nd now Work with Safe3 SQL Injector v8.4:
Screen Shot 1: Analyzing Vulnerable link and it says it’s vulnerable and gets keyword and db type.
Screen Shot 2: Now it’s Inject the vulnerable link and gets All Table list and column list
This is another Prove for this Website Vulnerability and we can see this and Dangerous thing is its Exploitable. Now we check our last SQL Injection tool for 100% Satisfy.
3rd Pangolin SQL Injection Tool:
Screen Shot 1: Scan vulnerable link and its say this website is vulnerable
Screen Shot 2: Now inject this Website and get tables and columns list
Screen Shot 3: Here is a full List of Tables and Columns list
Now I think we are 100% Sure Google Lab Website is SQL Injection Vulnerable.

UPDATE : 
Google insist that there has been no intrusion. The company claims that their GQL database won't allow SQL injection attacks. Additionally, they say that the data that appears in the screen shots, does not exist anywhere in their data stores.
On this Shadman Tanjim - Hackers Reply to Google "Proof it. because I am Also Proof it's Vulnerable. If they say's Google Lab is Not Vulnerable, It Means We get new Bugs in Some Famous SQL Injection tools. And also and 1=1 concept. So tell them to proof this and I don't think All tools are false. because 1 tools can false, 2 tools can get false but not All. ALL Tools say's it is Vulnerable, So i don't think it any confusion. :D "
