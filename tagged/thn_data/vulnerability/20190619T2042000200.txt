The reported vulnerability is a deserialization issue via XMLDecoder in Oracle WebLogic Server Web Services that could allow unauthorized remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the targeted servers and take control over them.
"This remote code execution vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password," the advisory said.
In a separate note, the company also revealed that the flaw is related to a previously known deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-2725) in Oracle WebLogic Server that it patched in April this year.
The previously patched RCE flaw in Oracle WebLogic was also exploited by attackers as a zero-day i.e., to distribute Sodinokibi ransomware and cryptocurrency mining malware.
Reported independently by a separate group of individuals and organizations, the new vulnerability affects Oracle WebLogic Server versions 10.3.6.0.0, 12.1.3.0.0, and 12.2.1.3.0
