Facebook is not Exclusion, XML Vulnerability !
All of you know that there are many vulnerabilities on various web-sites. But Grands websites like facebook, google, microsoft are very well secure and sometimes it's impossible to find even xss or SQLi on them. But the code, behind this web sites, is written with PEOPLE, and you can only patch human vulnerability on their Mind or DNA. :)))  What we want to say is, this isn't serious flaw or bug, vulnerability, but this is proove that even such website's contain security holes, and if you look through you can take them over. ;)  best wishes and happy Hacking. Oh yes, see NASA's report about bugs, our UNIVERSE is vulnerable too. :)))
