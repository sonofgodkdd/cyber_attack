Mohit Kumar

An exploit taking advantage of an unpatched vulnerability in Internet  Explorer (IE) has gone public.
Security researcher Shahin Ramezany said in a Tuesday tweet  that he was able to exploit the flaw, which involves the way IE handles  CSS style sheets on Windows 7 and Vista machines. 
A video  demonstrating code execution was posted Monday by Offensive Security, a  provider of security tools and training. 
On Wednesday, exploit code was published  as part of the open-source Metasploit  hacking toolkit.
The flaw is able to bypass two built-in Windows security features:  Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization  (ASLR), according to Ramezany.
Microsoft has not yet confirmed the vulnerability.
"We're currently unaware of any attacks trying to use the claimed  vulnerability or of customer impact," Dave Forstrom, director of  trustworthy computing at Microsoft, told SCMagazineUS.com on Wednesday  in an email. "Once we're done investigating, we will take appropriate  action to help protect customers."
