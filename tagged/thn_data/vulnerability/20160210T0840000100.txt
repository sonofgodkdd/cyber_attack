Every Windows version Affected:
One of the critical vulnerabilities affects all supported version of Windows, including Microsoft's newest Windows 10 operating system, as well as Windows Server 2016 Tech Preview 4.
The memory-corruption flaw (MS16-013) could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the logged-in user by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted Journal file.

This vulnerability would let the attacker run malicious programs on victim's machine, even delete data and create new accounts with full user rights.
Administrator accounts are at the greatest risk than users with a fewer user rights account on the system. However, the good news is the vulnerability has not been spotted in the wild.
