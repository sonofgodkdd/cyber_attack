A Facebook chat message and Windows Live Messenger message will also trigger the bug.Video Demonstration Both Apple and Google have suffered from SMS bugs with their iOS and Android devices. Security researcher Charlie Miller discovered a flaw in the iOS 3.0 software that allowed attackers complete control over an iPhone at the time.
