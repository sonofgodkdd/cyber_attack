Metasploit 3.5.1 adds Cisco device exploitation !
Mohit Kumar
Metasploit  now enables security professionals to exploit Cisco devices, performs  passive reconnaissance through traffic analysis, provides more exploits  and evaluates an organization’s password security by brute forcing an  ever increasing range of services.
This latest release adds stealth features, exposing common flaws in IDS  and IPS, and anti-virus threat detection. Team leaders may now impose  network range restrictions on projects and limit access to specific team  members.
Adding to its social engineering capabilities, Metasploit can also now  attach malicious files to emails, for example PDF and MP3 files that can  take control of a user’s machine.
The highlights of Metasploit version 3.5.1 are:
Gain access to Cisco devices. Metasploit now automatically  exploits authentication bypass flaws if present and can brute force  access through Telnet, Secure Shell, HTTP and SNMP protocols. After  successful exploitation, Metasploit downloads configuration files and  automatically extracts passwords, VPN keys, and wireless credentials.  These credentials can then be leveraged to gain deeper access to the  rest of the network. This version adds additional network device audit  and exploitation features (only available in Metasploit Express and  Metasploit Pro).
Silently discover of active networks. Metasploit imports network  traffic logs from the pcap packet capture files, identifying hosts,  services and clear-text passwords. This information is then used to plan  an active attack against the network. The new version also accelerates  the discovery of host discovery and port scans.
Brute force UNIX “r” services, VNC and SNMP. Adding to its broad  brute forcing capabilities, Metasploit now audits password security of  rshell, rlogin, rexec, VNC and SNMP services. UNIX "r" services leverage  discovered usernames for both the source and destination users fields  specified in these protocols.
Evade IPS/IDS and anti-virus systems. Metasploit includes  enhanced stealth options to avoid triggering IDS and IPS, the alarm  systems of modern networks. An enhanced anti-virus evasion ensures that  exploits are not stopped by end-point defenses.
Attach malicious  PDF and MP3 files to emails. Metasploit makes social  engineering attacks more sophisticated by adding malicious files to  emails, for example, PDF and MP3 files.
Run additional exploits. Metasploit adds exploits for SAP  BusinessObjects, Exim mail servers, ProFTPD file transfer installations,  SCADA deployments (BACnet, Citect, DATAC), Novell NetWare servers,  Microsoft Internet Explorer and browser plugins such as Adobe Flash and  Oracle Java.
