Tor Vulnerable to Remote arbitrary code Execution
According to latest post of Gentoo Linux Security Advisory, There are multiple vulnerabilities have been found in TOR, the most severe ofwhich may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. TOR is an implementation of second generation Onion Routing, a connection-oriented anonymizing communication service.
Using this Vulnerability remote attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service. Furthermore, a remote relay the user is directly connected to may be able to disclose anonymous information about that user or enumerate bridges in the user's connection.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); 
Advisory explain that , Affected Vulnerable packages are < 0.2.2.35 . Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Tor are listed below:
* When configured as client or bridge, Tor uses the same TLS certificate chain for all outgoing connections (CVE-2011-2768).
* When configured as a bridge, Tor relays can distinguish incoming bridge connections from client connections (CVE-2011-2769).
* An error in or/buffers.c could result in a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2011-2778).
All Tor users should upgrade to the latest version.
