ADOBE PATCH UPDATES
On Wednesday, Adobe released its recent set of security updates for the Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Reader and Acrobat software, including patches for some critical vulnerabilities.
Adobe patches at least 18 security holes in its Flash Player and AIR software. The updates are available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux versions of the software, addressing "vulnerabilities that could potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system," according to the company.
The Flash Player update addresses:
A number of remote code execution vulnerabilities
Four memory corruption vulnerabilities
One heap overflow vulnerability
One integer overflow bug
Three type confusion flaws
One use-after-free vulnerability
A time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition that bypasses Protected Mode in Internet Explorer
Validation bypass issues that could be exploited to write arbitrary data to the file system under user permissions
Memory leak vulnerabilities that could be used to bypass ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)
One security bypass vulnerability that could lead to information leaks
Affected Flash Player Versions:
Adobe Flash Player version 17.0.0.169 and earlier
Adobe Flash Player version 13.0.0.281 and earlier 13.x versions
Adobe Flash Player version 11.2.202.457 and earlier 11.x versions

AIR SDK and SDK & Compiler 17.0.0.144 and earlier versions
Adobe Reader and Acrobat update addresses:
Critical remote code execution vulnerabilities
Five use-after-free vulnerabilities
Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities
One buffer overflow vulnerability
Ten memory corruption vulnerabilities
Affected Adobe Reader and Acrobat Versions:
Adobe Reader XI (11.0.10) and earlier 11.x versions
Reader X (10.1.13) and earlier 10.x versions
Acrobat XI (11.0.10) and earlier 11.x versions
Acrobat X (10.1.13) and earlier 10.x versions
Adobe Acrobat Reader DC has not been affected in this security update.
Also, the latest Adobe update also resolves:
Various methods to bypass JavaScript API execution restrictions
A memory leak issue
A null-pointer dereference issue that could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attacks
An information disclosure bug in the handling of XML external entities that could lead to information disclosure
The company recommends its users to accept automatic updates for the Adobe Flash Player desktop runtime for Windows and Mac OS X when prompted or update manually via the Adobe Flash Player Download Center.
MOZILLA UPDATES
Mozilla addresses five critical flaws, five high-risk bugs and two moderately rated vulnerabilities in its Firefox 38.
One of the serious problems it fixes resides in Firefox 38 – An out-of-bounds read and write vulnerability in the JavaScript subset "asm.js" during the validation procedure, whose exploitation could lead an attacker to read parts of the memory that may contain users sensitive data.
Among the critical vulnerabilities is a buffer overflow in the way the browser parses compressed XML, which have been fixed in the latest Firefox 38 update.
The most important update in Firefox is that the new version of the browser includes a feature that enables the use of DRM-enabled (Digital Rights Management-enabled) video content in Firefox.
The latest Firefox browser update also includes an integration with the Adobe Content Decryption Module (CDM), allowing users to play DRM-wrapped content in HTML5 video tag.
"A year ago, we announced the start of efforts to implement support for a component in Firefox that would allow content wrapped in Digital Rights Management (DRM) to be played within the HTML5 video tag. This was a hard decision," the company states in the blog post.
"As we explained then, we are enabling DRM to provide our users with the features they require in a browser and allow them to continue accessing premium video content. We don’t believe DRM is a desirable market solution, but it’s currently the only way to watch a sought-after segment of content."
To reimburse, Mozilla has also designed a sandbox that encompasses the CDM, restricting interaction with sensitive parts of the system and the browser. In addition, the Mozilla developer is also offering a version of Firefox 38 that doesn’t include the CDM component from the browser.
