Comodo Hacked - Reseller private data exposed !
Another official reseller of SSL certificate authority Comodo has suffered a security breach that allowed attackers to gain unauthorized access to data. Brazil-based ComodoBR is at least the fourth Comodo partner to be compromised this year. Customer details like organization names, addresses, telephones, domain names, type of web servers, serial numbers and more, are also included.
There is also a list of what appears to be employee accounts, with @comdobr.com email addresses and hashed passwords. The password for an account called validacao@comodobr.com (validation@) is listed in plain text.
