Not only spam’s but this bug can be used to post illegitimate messages to Facebook users from their friends or either from unknown people without the consent of sender
Total Exposure :  Knowledge of Facebook id and associated registered email address are the key elements to launch the exploit i.e., to postage of factitious messages on behalf of target user. Other than posting messages, spams are equally potential through this vulnerability.

Update:
One year before we report this Vulnerability on blog and also to Facebook, But today we found that its still works :P  , One new update added by ZeRtOx from a group called devitel that facebook will not show warning in yellow color if user 2 email id is of some uncommon domain, like anything@anything.com . If user 2 email is of gmail, hotmail yahoo or another famous service then faceebook will also show a warning message in inbox of user 1.
